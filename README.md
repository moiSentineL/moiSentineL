Hello There!
</h2>

I am Nibir, just another user with an ulterior motive to get more stars and sponsors. Just kidding! **I am here to build cool stuff!** 

#### What I like to build (and what I've built):
- Automations: [pdflinkextractor](https://github.com/moiSentineL/pdflinkextractor)
- Scholarly stuff: [explanatory](https://github.com/moiSentineL/explanatory), [tenthnotes](https://github.com/moiSentineL/tenthnotes)
- Making knowledge more accessible: [oxford-general-philosophy-2009](https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009)
- Programs which make life easier: [flomo](https://github.com/moiSentineL/flomo), [dicto](https://github.com/moiSentineL/dicto)

#### Some of my beliefs on building:
- Open-sourcing is better than proprietary development.
- Linux >> Windows
- Knowledge should be shared for free; Education itself should be free.

I don't only code, [I do more stuff](https://nibirsan.org/)!
